            <h1>Liberate devices to maintain <b>software autonomy</b></h1>
            <p>
                The manufacturer of an electronic device does not need a monopoly to deliver a good product. Separate the copyrights between hardware and software to maintain an open market on existing and new devices.

                <h6>How it works</h6>
                <h2>Why <b>software autonomy</b>?</h2>
                <p>Electronic devices like Apple's iPhone, the Oculus Quest 2 and countless IoT devices do not allow you to uninstall any software without the vendor's permission. These walled gardens often contain software that monitors your usage of the device.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, hobbyists and developers create "jailbreaks" which frees the device from the company's grasp and let you use your product without getting spied on. Most of these jailbreaks never see the light of day, however, because their creators fear getting sued by an army of lawyers from big tech companies like Facebook.</p>

                <div class="text">
                    <h4>How can we fix this?</h4>
                    <p>Jailbreaks should be protected by the law so that devices like the smartphone remain an open market and users always have an option that respects their privacy.</p>
                    <p>There are already a lot of jailbreaks legal in many countries for lots of devices,but companies like Apple still forbid jailbreaks in their terms of service and sue jailbreakers for infringing copyrights. This effectively shuts down a lot of jailbreaking, and can be fought by the acknowledgement that a jailbreak respects copyright laws.</p>

                <h2>Oculus Quest 2</h2>
                <p>A typical example would be <a href="https://www.oculus.com/quest-2/">Facebook's Oculus Quest 2</a>, which doesn't allow you to use the VR headset without using a Facebook account and can even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-10-15-oculus-quest-2s-are-being-bricked-by-facebook-account-merge-issues" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-2">remotely prohibit you from using your own device</a>, which means <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/oculus-quest-2-vr-headset/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-3">you cannot use the headset privately</a>. (The alternative exists to buy <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2021/04/oculus-quest-facebook-cost/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-4">a separate and significantly more expensive headset</a>.)</p>
                <p>There are several rumours that jailbreaks have been built, and the non-profit organisation Extended Reality Safety Initiative (XRSI in short) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-10-28-hackers-reportedly-jailbreak-the-oculus-quest-2-bypassing-its-forced-facebook-login" >has validated a jailbreak</a>, but many jailbreakers are hesitant to publish their work, fearing that an army of Facebook lawyers may harm their career.</p>

                        In contrary to Mickey Mouse, not being able to use software from a dead person may harm humans. Hence software should become public domain at the end of its lifecycle.
