                    <p>
                        As a result of a Facebook employee making a small BGP mistake, Facebook's entire infrastructure is down: Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are all no longer accessible for a while.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/" target="_blank">Jeff Geerling</a> as told in the video below, the problem goes even further where Facebook employees cannot even enter Facebook buildings as a result of the keycards being connected to Facebook's infrastructure, making solving the issues even more difficult.
                    </p>
                    <div class="img-center">
                        <iframe class="expanding-iframe" swidth="560" sheight="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KLqH8p1QVpY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                    <h2>Why move to Matrix?</h2>
                    <p>
                        As the platform <a href="https://matrix.org/" target="_blank">claims on their website</a>, Matrix' decentralised nature allows for no single points of failure. No single Matrix employee could disrupt or even block the entire network's communication for any amount of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Matrix works in federated servers: everyone has the option (and is encouraged) to create their own server and add it to the Matrix network. That way, if one server goes down, all the other servers are still available for online business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The example below shows how a centralized service like Facebook has an obvious server node that would cancel all communication if it were to gain issues, (like as of the time of writing the article) whereas no such point exists in a decentralized service like Matrix.
                    </p>

                    <div class="img-center">

                    <h2>How do I move to Matrix?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Install either <a href="https://element.io/" target="_blank">Element</a> or <a href="https://fluffychat.im/" target="_blank">FluffyChat</a> on your phone. Either app is fine, and they're both connected to the Matrix network. Choose a homeserver like <b>matrix.org</b>, <b>chat.privacytools.io</b> or <b>chat.weho.st</b> and you'll be good to go. Both apps respect your privacy, have end-to-end encryption by default and allow you to connect to whomever you want.
                    </p>
                    <p>
