            <h1>Preserve the <b>freedom to install</b> whatever you want</h1>
            <p>
                You are the only one to decide what is or isn't installed on your phone, laptop or other device. If you buy an electronic device from a company, they shouldn't be able to force you to have specific apps or software installed on it.

                <h6>How it works</h6>
                <h2>Why <b>freedom of installation</b>?</h2>
                <p>For many products like a laptop or an Android smartphone, it makes sense that you decide what runs on your computer. However, some smartphones contain apps that you cannot uninstall - but they still take up memory, storage space and sometimes even slow down the device that you bought.</p>
                <p>During the pandemic, many universities have started requiring students to install proctoring software on their devices to monitor their laptops during exams. In the same way, platforms like Discord and WhatsApp ban users who write "self-bots" because they don't use the standard app.</p>

                    <h4>How can we fix this?</h4>
                    <p>Our mindset needs to change that you should always be able to run code that you trust. If you don't want to run any presented software, you can either use it or find (or create) an alternative yourself.</p>
                    <p>Organisations and companies can deliver client software that their users may run, but using that software should never be obligated or required. It should always be possible for users to write an alternative client that interacts with a server in the same way.</p>
