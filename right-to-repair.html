            <h1>Let's take back our <b>right to repair</b> anything that breaks</h1>
            <p>
                Most electronic products erode over time: rubber handles can wear off, a fan in a computer might stop spinning or your charger may break. In those cases, you should be able to repair the broken parts instead of having to buy a complete new device.

                    <h6>How it works</h6>
                    <h2>Why <b>Right to Repair</b>?</h2>
                    <p>When your smartphone breaks down because a small chip or electronic part has stopped working, the original manufacturer often repairs the device only at a price so high that you might as well buy a new phone. Repairment can often take weeks and all data is wiped from the device during the repairment, which leaves you a large bill and a loss of all your data on your smartphone.</p>
                    <p>In reality, many individual chips only cost a tiny amount, and repairment wouldn't be so expensive if the manufacturers had repair shops as competition. This is not the case, however, because companies explicitly get factories to refuse selling electronic parts to repair shops. This is an effective shutdown of the repair market and allows vendors to charge repairs at ridiculous prices.</p>

                    <div><h4>How can we fix this?</h4>
                        <p>You shouldn't need to buy a new and expensive printer every year. Instead, you should be able to repair your printer for a small price if something small breaks. Manufacturers of electronic devices should be forced to share all the information needed to reapir the device and all the parts should be accessible to buy for anyone.</p>

                    <h1>You can't repair your iPhone 13</h1>
                    <p>
                        As reported by the Right to Repair Europe campaign, <a href="https://repair.eu/news/the-new-iphone-13-comes-with-bad-news-for-third-party-repairs/" target="_blank">the iPhone 13 disables Face ID if you repair your broken screen,</a> even if it's being repaired with an official Apple part.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Making iPhones impossible to repair for independent repair shops gives Apple more freedom to demand outrageous prices for phone repairs. A repaired screen does not pose a security risk and it is not reasonable to block phone features like the Face ID as a security measure.
