<h1>Ensuring that <b>software warranty</b> lasts much longer </h1>
<p>Unlike physical objects, software doesn't erode over time. If you pay for a smartphone app, it's shouldn't break after a few days. Just like any other product that you buy, software should have a warranty; one that lasts much longer. </p>

<h6>How it works </h6>
<h2>Why <b>software warranty</b>? </h2>
<p>Any product bought in the European Union has a limited warranty: if the product breaks or misbehaves during that period, you can either get the product repaired or replaced, or you can get your money back. </p>
<p>The duration of the warranty usually depends on the type of product. It is reasonable for a smartphone to last at least 2 years, but a banana probably wouldn't last that long. For <b>software</b>, however, there is no determined duration of how long software should "reasonably" last if you buy it. </p>

<h4>How can we fix this? </h4>
<p>If you buy an app from an app store, it should work - and if it doesn't work or if it becomes unusuable after a while, you should get your money back. </p>
<p>We should start treating apps and software like products: if you pay for it, there should be a warranty. Experts should determine how long an app should reasonably work, and then those warranties need to be legislated. </p>

<h4>Personal experience </h4>
<h1>Nobody knows </h1>
<p><i>How long is the warranty on software? ðŸ”– Turns out that that's something nobody knows. </i></p>
<p><i>I have called the Dutch authority on warranties, the technical authority, a software vendor and the legal counter for citizens, and none of them were able to give me an answer. ðŸ™ˆ </i></p>
<p><i>I was advised to consult a lawyer because "maybe they'll know". </i></p>
