            <h1>Ensuring that <b>software warranty</b> lasts much longer</h1>
            <p>
                Unlike physical objects, software doesn't erode over time. If you pay for a smartphone app, it's shouldn't break after a few days. Just like any other product that you buy, software should have a warranty; one that lasts much longer.

                <h6>How it works</h6>
                <h2>Why <b>software warranty</b>?</h2>
                <p>Any product bought in the European Union has a limited warranty: if the product breaks or misbehaves during that period, you can either get the product repaired or replaced, or you can get your money back.</p>
                <p>The duration of the warranty usually depends on the type of product. It is reasonable for a smartphone to last at least 2 years, but a banana probably wouldn't last that long. For <b>software</b>, however, there is no determined duration of how long software should "reasonably" last if you buy it. </p>

                    <h4>How can we fix this?</h4>
                    <p>If you buy an app from an app store, it should work - and if it doesn't work or if it becomes unusuable after a while, you should get your money back.</p>
                    <p>We should start treating apps and software like products: if you pay for it, there should be a warranty. Experts should determine how long an app should reasonably work, and then those warranties need to be legislated.</p>
